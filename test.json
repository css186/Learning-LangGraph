You mentioned considering a brute force solution using two nested loops. That's a valid approach, but let's explore it a bit more and see if we can optimize it.\n\n### Brute Force Approach\n1. **Understanding the Brute Force Solution**: \n   - You would iterate through each element in the array with the first loop.\n   - For each element, you would use a second loop to check every other element to see if the two elements add up to the target.\n   - If they do, you would return their indices.\n\n2. **Time Complexity**: \n   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) because for each element, you are potentially checking every other element.\n\n3. **Space Complexity**: \n   - The space complexity is O(1) since you are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.\n\n### Questions for the Candidate\n- Can you describe how you would implement this brute force solution in Python?\n- What would you do if the input array is very large? Would you still use the brute force method?\n\n### Optimized Approach\nNow, let's think about how we can optimize this solution. \n\n1. **Using a Hash Map**:\n   - We can use a dictionary (hash map) to store the numbers we have seen so far and their corresponding indices.\n   - As we iterate through the array, for each number, we can check if the complement (target - current number) exists in the hash map.\n   - If it does, we return the indices of the current number and its complement.\n   - If it doesn't, we add the current number and its index to the hash map.\n\n2. **Time Complexity**:\n   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we only pass through the array once.\n   - The space complexity is also O(n) due to the hash map storing the elements.\n\n### Implementation\nWould you like to try implementing the optimized solution using a hash map? If you need help, I can guide you through it.\n\n### Feedback\n- Your initial thought process of using a brute force solution is a good starting point, especially for understanding the problem.\n- However, it's important to consider the efficiency of your solution, especially for larger datasets.\n- Exploring alternative approaches, like using a hash map, can significantly improve performance and is a common technique in coding interviews.\n\nFeel free to share your implementation or any questions you have about the optimized approach!", "current_code": "print(\"hello\")", "description": "Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
